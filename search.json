    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce you to methods of spatial data analysis. The focus is on both the conceptual and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. We will place particular emphasis on the computational aspects of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) methods for diﬀerent types of spatial data with a particular focus on point processes and lattice (areal unit) data. Throughout the course you will gain valuable hands-on experience with several specialized software packages for spatial data analysis. The overriding goal of the course is for you to acquire familiarity with the fundamental methodological and operational issues in the statistical analysis of geographic information and the ability to extend these methods in your own research.\nThe course takes an explicitly computational thinking approach to its pedagogy. Students are introduced to computational concepts and tools that are increasingly important to research that engages with geospatial data. By adopting these tools, students acquire a deeper engagement with, and mastery of, the substantive concepts. Put differently, students will learn to code. But this is a means to the end goal: students will code to learn spatial data analysis.\nIn the scope of a 15-week semester course we can only introduce a handful of the key concepts and methods relevant to the field of spatial data analysis. As such, the course is not intended as an exhaustive treatment. Instead, the goal is that students will acquire an understanding of the more common and useful methods and practices, and use the course as an entry point for further engagement with the field."

Students are expected to watch the assigned lecture videos prior to the Tuesday meetings.\nThis structure allows us to make the most effective use of in-class time. Rather than repeating foundational material during class, scheduled meetings will emphasize experiential learning, including:\n\nGuided computational exercises\nHands-on spatial data analysis workflows\nCollaborative problem-solving\nDiscussion and interpretation of analytical results\n\nTuesday sessions will build directly on the prerecorded material, assuming prior engagement with the concepts, terminology, and methods introduced in the videos. Students who arrive unprepared will find it difficult to participate fully in class activities.\nThis approach is designed to support deeper learning by shifting lower-level content acquisition outside the classroom and reserving in-person time for higher-order skills such as application, synthesis, and interpretation."

    "section": "Grading Philosophy: Specification Grading",
    "text": "Grading Philosophy: Specification Grading\nThis course uses specification grading, a mastery-based grading system in which grades are earned by demonstrating competency at clearly defined performance thresholds, rather than by accumulating points or percentages.\nEach letter grade corresponds to a set of required competencies. To earn a given grade, you must meet all requirements at that grade level. Performance does not average across categories, and exceeding one requirement does not compensate for falling short in another.\n\n\nComponent Definitions\n\nCourse Components at a Glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nCount\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nExercises (Assignments)\n5\nEach spans two weeks\n\n\nQuizzes\n13\nWeekly, short conceptual checks\n\n\nLecture Participation\n~15\nIn-class experiential activities\n\n\nComputational Essay\n1\nRequired for A− and above\n\n\nTokens\n2\nUsed for assignment revision or quiz recovery\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nMajor applied exercises focused on spatial data handling, analysis, and interpretation. Each exercise is evaluated on a satisfactory / not yet satisfactory basis according to published specifications emphasizing correctness, clarity, and reproducibility.\nEach exercise is due at 11:59pm on the Sunday at the end of its second week.\n\n\nQuizzes\nShort assessments of key concepts, terminology, and methods in spatial data analysis. Only quizzes meeting specifications count toward grade thresholds.\n\n\nLP — Lecture Participation\nActive engagement during lecture sessions through structured activities, discussions, short exercises, or in-class analysis tasks. Each participation unit must meet stated criteria to count as satisfactory. One LP unit is earned through satisfactory participation in a designated in-class activity (e.g., guided exercise, discussion, or analysis task). Most weeks offer one LP opportunity per meeting.\n\n\nCE — Computational Essay\nA substantial integrative analysis of a spatial data problem, supported by computation (code, maps, figures, and results).\n\nA level: Computational Essay must be submitted and presented\n\nA− level: Computational Essay must be submitted\n\nBelow A−: Computational Essay not required\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Grades Are Determined\n\nGrade Thresholds\nYour final course grade is the highest grade level for which all required competencies have been demonstrated.\n\n\n\nLevel\nAssignments\nQuizzes\nLP\nCE\n\n\n\n\nA\n5\n13\n13\nPresented\n\n\nA-\n5\n12\n12\nSubmitted\n\n\nB+\n4\n11\n11\n\n\n\nB\n4\n10\n10\n\n\n\nB-\n4\n9\n9\n\n\n\nC+\n3\n8\n8\n\n\n\nC\n3\n6\n6\n\n\n\nC-\n3\n5\n5\n\n\n\nD+\n2\n4\n4\n\n\n\nD\n2\n3\n3\n\n\n\nD-\n2\n2\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery requirement in a grade row must be satisfied.\nMeeting a higher threshold automatically satisfies all lower thresholds.\nIf any single requirement is not met, the final grade is the highest fully satisfied lower level.\nThere is no curve and no partial credit.\n\n\n\n\nWorked Example\nSuppose a student completes:\n\nAssignments: 5\n\nQuizzes: 12\n\nLecture Participation: 11\n\nComputational Essay: Submitted\n\nThe A− threshold requires 12 Lecture Participation units. Since that requirement is not met, the highest fully satisfied threshold is B+.\nFinal grade: B+.\n\n\n\n\nRevision and Resubmission\nLearning in spatial data analysis is iterative.\n\nMany components may be revised and resubmitted after feedback.\nA revised submission that meets specifications will count as satisfactory.\nDeadlines and revision limits are specified with each component.\n\n\n\n\nToken Policy (Specification Grading)\nTo support flexibility, revision, and student agency within the specification grading framework, this course uses a token system.\n\nInitial Allocation\n\nEach student begins the semester with two (2) tokens.\nTokens are personal, non-transferable, and tracked by the student.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Tokens\n\nAssignment Resubmissions\n\nOne (1) token may be used to resubmit an assignment that received a grade of Not Yet Satisfactory.\nA token allows one additional resubmission attempt beyond any revisions already permitted by default.\nThe resubmitted work must address the specific feedback provided.\nA resubmission that meets specifications will be recorded as Satisfactory.\n\nEnd-of-Semester Quiz Recovery\n\nAny unused tokens remaining at the end of Week 15 will be automatically applied to quizzes.\nOne (1) token may be exchanged for one (1) missed or failed quiz, converting it to Satisfactory.\nTokens are applied only after Week 15, not on a rolling basis during the semester.\nStudents do not need to take action for this conversion; it will be handled automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Rules and Clarifications\n\nTokens are optional; students are not required to use them.\nTokens may be used at the student’s discretion, but once spent, they are gone.\nTokens do not roll over between semesters.\nTokens cannot be combined or split.\nTokens cannot be used to satisfy requirements other than assignment resubmissions or quiz recovery.\n\nStudents are encouraged to think strategically about token use:\n\nUse tokens early if revision will meaningfully improve mastery.\nReserve tokens if you anticipate missing quizzes later in the semester.\nRemember that tokens do not change grade thresholds; they only help you meet them.\n\n\nThe token system is designed to:\n\nEncourage revision and learning from feedback\nProvide flexibility for unavoidable disruptions\nReduce anxiety around isolated setbacks\nMaintain the integrity and clarity of specification grading thresholds\n\nStudents are encouraged to track their own progress relative to grade thresholds and to consult the instructor if they are unsure how or when to use a token."

Lecture Participation is a required component of the course.\n\n\nLate Work\nWork that does not meet specifications by the deadline will be marked Not Yet Satisfactory. Policies for late submission and revision are described with each assignment.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nStudents are expected to follow university policies on academic honesty. All submitted work must be original, with appropriate citation of data sources, code, and references.\n\n\nAccessibility\nStudents requiring accommodations should contact the instructor and the university’s accessibility services as early as possible.\n\n\nUse of AI Tools\nThis course recognizes that AI-assisted tools (including large language models and code assistants) are increasingly part of contemporary computational and analytical workflows. Responsible use of AI tools is permitted in this course, subject to the guidelines below.\n\nPermitted Use\nStudents may use AI tools to:\n\nClarify concepts, terminology, or methodological ideas\n\nAssist with debugging code or understanding error messages\n\nExplore alternative approaches to a computational task\n\n\n\nExpectations and Limitations\n\nAll submitted work must reflect the student’s own understanding and decision-making.\n\nAI tools may not be used to generate complete solutions, analyses, or written interpretations submitted as the student’s own work.\n\nStudents are responsible for verifying the correctness and appropriateness of any AI-assisted code or explanations they use.\n\nWork that does not demonstrate individual understanding, even if technically correct, will be marked Not Yet Satisfactory.\n\n\n\nDisclosure Requirement\nIf an AI tool is used in a substantive way (for example, generating code structure, suggesting analytical steps, or drafting text), students must acknowledge its use in a short markdown cell or code comment. The disclosure should briefly state:\n\nThe tool used\n\nThe type of assistance provided\n\nFailure to disclose substantive AI use will be treated as a violation of academic integrity.\n\n\nRationale\nThe purpose of this policy is to encourage transparent, ethical, and effective engagement with AI tools while maintaining the course’s emphasis on learning, mastery, and reproducibility. AI tools should support—not replace—the development of spatial data analysis skills."
